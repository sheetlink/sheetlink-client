# SheetLink v0.5.1 - UX + Link + Sandbox Copy Cleanup

**Date:** November 10, 2025  
**Version:** v0.5.1 (Patch)  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

---

## Overview

Implemented PRD v0.5.1 to improve copy naturalness, fix broken links, and align sandbox instructions with the current Plaid UI experience.

---

## ✅ Changes Implemented

### 1️⃣ Global Copy Cleanup

**Replaced all em dashes (—) with natural punctuation:**

#### Privacy Page (`/privacy`)
- **Before:** "Privacy isn't a feature—it's the foundation."
- **After:** "Privacy isn't a feature. It's the foundation."

- **Before:** "Transactions flow from Plaid to your spreadsheet—nowhere else."
- **After:** "Transactions flow from Plaid to your spreadsheet - nowhere else."

- **Before:** "Delete it whenever you want—SheetLink has no copy."
- **After:** "Delete it whenever you want - SheetLink has no copy."

- **Before:** "Handled exclusively by Plaid—never by SheetLink."
- **After:** "Handled exclusively by Plaid - never by SheetLink."

- **Before:** "Transparent data pipe—not a data vault."
- **After:** "Transparent data pipe - not a data vault."

#### All SEO Titles
- **Before:** `Privacy Policy — SheetLink`
- **After:** `Privacy Policy - SheetLink`

Applied to: `/privacy`, `/beta`, `/sandbox`, `/docs`

---

### 2️⃣ Fixed Broken & Outdated Links

**Removed broken self-hosting link:**
- **Location:** `/landing/src/pages/privacy.tsx:209-212`
- **Before:** Link to `/docs/sandbox` with text "See the self-hosting guide"
- **After:** "Full self-hosting guide coming soon." (no broken link)

**Verified correct internal links:**
- ✅ `/privacy` - working
- ✅ `/beta` - working  
- ✅ `/sandbox` - working
- ✅ Header navigation: "Docs · Privacy · Beta" - all working

---

### 3️⃣ Sandbox Flow Copy Update

**Updated `/sandbox` to match current Plaid UI:**

#### Old Copy (Outdated)
```
Step 2: Click "Connect Account"
Step 3: Choose "Plaid Sandbox Bank"
  - First Platypus Bank
  - Tattersall Federal Credit Union
  - Houndstooth Bank
Step 4: Use these test credentials to authenticate
Step 5: Choose which sandbox accounts to connect
```

#### New Copy (Canonical)
```
Step 2: Click "Connect to Sandbox"
Step 3: Select Any Institution
  When Plaid opens, select any institution (for example, Chase or Bank of America).
  ✅ You're in Sandbox mode - all data is simulated.
Step 4: When prompted for credentials, use:
  - Username: user_good
  - Password: pass_good
  - Phone: (415) 555-0123
  - Code: 123456
Step 5: Sync Sample Data
  Once connected, click "Sync Sample Data" to populate your Sheet.
  You can reset anytime from the options page.
```

**Files Updated:**
- `/landing/src/pages/sandbox.tsx`

**Alignment with Real Plaid Experience:**
- ✅ No fake bank names (First Platypus, etc.)
- ✅ Real institution examples (Chase, Bank of America)
- ✅ Clear "You're in Sandbox mode" messaging
- ✅ Simplified flow (5 clear steps)

---

### 4️⃣ Privacy & Sandbox Copy Consistency

**Added sandbox mention to privacy page:**
- **Location:** `/landing/src/pages/privacy.tsx:32-34`
- **New text:** "You can test with Plaid Sandbox before connecting real accounts."

**Self-hosting copy update:**
- **Old:** Link to non-existent `/docs/sandbox` guide
- **New:** "Full self-hosting guide coming soon."

---

### 5️⃣ MetaMask Error Documentation

**Created:** `/docs/dev-notes.md`

**Content:**
```markdown
## MetaMask Console Warnings

**Symptom:** When running `npm run dev`, you may see:
"Failed to connect to MetaMask"

**Cause:** Chrome extensions injecting `window.ethereum` during Next.js dev.
**Solution:** Ignore - not related to SheetLink.
```
