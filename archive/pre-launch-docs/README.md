# Pre-Launch Documentation Archive

This directory contains documentation that was moved here before the public launch. These files are kept for reference but are not intended for public distribution until SheetLink goes live with production features.

## Archived Files

### Launch & Deployment
- **LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md** - Production launch checklist (archived until launch)
- **deploy-checklist.md** - Deployment procedures (archived until needed)
- **vercel-deployment-guide.md** - Vercel deployment guide (archived until needed)

### Features Not Yet Live
- **TEMPLATES.md** - Template gallery creator guide (feature not launched yet)
- **self-host.md** - Self-hosting guide (not promoting until production)

### Internal Documentation
- **dev-notes.md** - Developer notes (internal only)
- **SECURITY-detailed.md** - Detailed security documentation (replaced by root SECURITY.md)
- **ANALYTICS.md** - Analytics setup (internal reference)
- **brand-build.mjs** - Brand asset build script (internal tooling)

## Why These Were Archived

These documents were moved to maintain a clean, focused public repository for:
1. **Plaid Production Review** - Cleaner repo = easier review
2. **Chrome Web Store Review** - Focus on user-facing documentation only
3. **Public Transparency** - Only show what's currently available

## When to Restore

These files can be moved back to their original locations when:
- Production launch is complete (LAUNCH_CHECKLIST, deploy-checklist)
- Template gallery feature goes live (TEMPLATES.md)
- Self-hosting is actively promoted (self-host.md)
- Vercel redeployment is needed (vercel-deployment-guide.md)

**Archived**: January 2025
**Reason**: Pre-launch cleanup for Plaid & Chrome Store review
